## Case Sensitivity in MongoDB
- Collection names are case-sensitive. Field names within documents are also case-sensitive.

```javascript
db.Product.insertOne({ name: 'thapa', age: 30 });
db.product.insertOne({ name: 'thapa', age: 30 });
```

## When to Use Quotes and When Not To?
### Special Characters
- `If a field name contains special characters or spaces, or starts with a numeric digit, using quotes is necessary`.

### Reserved Words
`If a field name is a reserved keyword in MongoDB, use quotes to distinguish it from the reserved keyword.`
