## 1. find()
- The find() method is used to query documents from a collection. It returns a cursor to the documents that match the query criteria.
- Syntax:
```js
db.collection.find(query, projection)
query: Specifies selection criteria using query operators.
projection: Specifies the fields to include or exclude (0 to exclude, 1 to include).
```
- Example:
- This finds all users whose age is greater than 25.
```js
db.users.find({ "age": { $gt: 25 } })
```


### findOne()
- The findOne() method returns a single document that satisfies the query criteria.
- Syntax:
```js
db.collection.findOne(query, projection)
query: Specifies selection criteria using query operators.
projection: Specifies the fields to include or exclude.
```
- Example:
- This finds the first user with the username "john_doe".
```js
db.users.findOne({ "username": "john_doe" })

```

## 2. limit, skip, sort and count the results of the find() method
### limit: 
    - Restricts the number of documents returned by the query.
- Example:
```js
db.users.find().limit(10)
//This limits the result to the first 10 documents.
```

### skip: 
    - Skips a specified number of documents in the query result.
- Example:
- This skips the first 5 documents in the result set.
```js
db.users.find().skip(5)
```

### sort: 
    - Sorts the query results by one or more fields.
- Example:
- This sorts the results by age in descending order.
```js
db.users.find().sort({ "age": -1 })
```

### count: 
    - Returns the count of documents that match the query criteria.
- Example:
- This counts the number of users whose age is greater than 25.
```js
db.users.find({ "age": { $gt: 25 } }).count()
```

## 3. Query Document â€“ Using AND, OR and IN Conditions
### AND Condition: 
    - By default, MongoDB combines multiple query conditions with an AND operation.
- Example:
```js
db.users.find({ "age": { $gt: 25 }, "status": "active" })
//This finds users whose age is greater than 25 and status is "active".
```

### OR Condition: 
    - Uses the $or operator to specify multiple conditions, at least one of which must be true.
- Example:
```js
db.users.find({ $or: [{ "age": { $lt: 18 } }, { "status": "inactive" }] })
//This finds users who are either younger than 18 or have an inactive status.
```

### IN Condition: 
    - Uses the $in operator to specify an array of possible values.
- Example:
```js
db.users.find({ "status": { $in: ["active", "pending"] } })
//This finds users whose status is either "active" or "pending".
```

## 4. find() method with Projection
- Projection specifies which fields to return in the documents that match the query criteria. It can be used to include or exclude fields.
- Syntax:
```js
db.collection.find(query, projection)
query: Specifies selection criteria using query operators.
projection: Specifies the fields to include (1) or exclude (0).
```

## 5. find() in array and object
### find within an object ("obj1.field1": '') 
> NOTE: double quotes for object is must
```js
db.myCollection1.find({"address.city": "boston"});
```

### find within an array ("array1": 'arrayval1') 
>NOTE: double quotes for object is must
```js
db.myCollection1.find({"array1": "arrayval1"});
```

# Embedded Documents
- Query documents inside embedded documents using dot notation.
```javascript
db.collection.find({ "parent.child": value })
```

## $all vs $elemMatch
- The $all operator selects the documents where the `value of a field is an array that contains all the specified elements.`
```js
{ <field>: { $all: [ <value1>, <value2>, ... ] } }
```

- The $elemMatch operator `matches documents that contain an array field with at least one element` that matches all the specified query criteria.
```js
{ <field>: { $elemMatch: { <query1>, <query2>, ... } } }
```

# Projection
```javascript
db.collection.find({}, { field1: 1, field2: 1 })
```
- To include specific fields, use projection with a value of 1 for the fields you want.
- To exclude fields, use projection with a value of 0 for the fields you want to exclude.
- You cannot include and exclude fields simultaneously in the same query projection.
