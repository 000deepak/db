## insert 
```js
// creates collection automatically, when you insert some document.
db.myCollection1.insert({"name" : "myCollection1"})  

// insert at least one document
db.myCollection1.insert({"name":"author 1"})  
db.myCollection1.insert({"title":"author 1 1"})
db.myCollection1.insert({"title":"author 1 2"})
db.myCollection1.insert({"title":"author 1 3"})

db.myCollection1.insert({
	firstName: "fn1",
	lastName: "ln1"
})

db.myCollection1.find().pretty();

db.myCollection1.insert(
	[
		{
			firstName: "fn3",
			lastName: "ln3"
		},
		{
			firstName: "fn2",
			lastName: "ln2",
			gender: "male"
		}
	]
)
```

## BulkWriteResults
- this object encapsulates the result of a bulk write operation, which can include multiple operations like inserts, updates, deletes, or a combination of these.
```js
    // Define an array of documents to insert
    const documents = [
      { name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
      { name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
      { name: 'Charlie', age: 35 }
    ];

    // Perform the bulk write operation
    const bulkWriteResult = await collection.bulkWrite([
      { insertOne: { document: documents[0] } },
      { insertOne: { document: documents[1] } },
      { insertOne: { document: documents[2] } }
    ]);
db.myCollection1.find().pretty();
```

# Upsert & Insert
In database operations, particularly in MongoDB, the terms "upsert" and "insert" have distinct meanings and uses. Here is an explanation of each:

## Insert
Insert is an operation that adds a new document to a collection. If the document already exists (based on a unique identifier like _id), the insert operation will fail.

Example of Insert:
```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({ _id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 });
In this example, a new document with _id 1, name "Alice", and age 30 is inserted into the collection. If a document with _id 1 already exists, this operation will result in an error.
```

## Upsert
Upsert is a combination of "update" and "insert". It attempts to update a document if it exists; if it does not exist, it inserts the document. This is useful when you want to ensure a document exists in the collection, regardless of its current state.

Example of Upsert:
```js
db.collection.updateOne(
  { _id: 1 },
  { $set: { name: "Alice", age: 30 } },
  { upsert: true }
);
```
In this example, MongoDB searches for a document with _id 1. If it finds one, it updates the name and age fields. If it does not find one, it inserts a new document with _id 1, name "Alice", and age 30.

## Comparison:
- Insert:
	- Adds a new document.
	- Fails if the document already exists (based on _id).
- Upsert:
	- Updates an existing document if it matches the query.
	- Inserts a new document if no match is found.

## Practical Use:
- Insert is used when you are sure that the document being added is new and does not already exist in the collection.
- Upsert is used when you want to ensure that a document is present in the collection, and you are okay with either updating an existing document or inserting a new one if it does not exist.
