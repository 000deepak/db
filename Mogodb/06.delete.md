# Deleting Documents in MongoDB
MongoDB provides methods to delete documents from collections. These methods allow you to remove documents based on specific criteria or delete all documents in a collection.

## 1. Delete Methods
### Delete a Single Document: deleteOne()
The deleteOne() method deletes a single document that matches the specified filter criteria.

Syntax:
```js
db.collection.deleteOne(filter, options)
filter: Specifies the selection criteria for the delete operation.
options: Optional parameters like writeConcern.
```

Example:
```js
db.users.deleteOne({ "username": "john_doe" })
```
This deletes the document with the username "john_doe" from the users collection.

### Delete Multiple Documents: deleteMany()
The deleteMany() method deletes all documents that match the specified filter criteria.

Syntax:
```js
db.collection.deleteMany(filter, options)
filter: Specifies the selection criteria for the delete operation.
options: Optional parameters like writeConcern.
```

Example:
```js
db.users.deleteMany({ "status": "inactive" })
```
This deletes all documents from the users collection where the status is "inactive".

## 2. Delete Options
- Write Concern
- Write concern specifies the level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for delete operations.
Example:
```js
db.users.deleteMany({ "status": "inactive" }, { writeConcern: { w: "majority", j: true, wtimeout: 5000 } })
```
This deletes all documents from the users collection where the status is "inactive" with the specified write concern.

## Summary
- Single Document Deletion: Use deleteOne() to delete a single document.
- Multiple Document Deletion: Use deleteMany() to delete multiple documents.
- Delete Options: Utilize options like writeConcern for specifying the acknowledgment level.


- remove all document of something
```js	
 db.myCollection1.remove(
 {firstName: "fn1"}
);
```

- remove 1st document
```js	
db.myCollection1.remove(
{firstName: "fn1"},
{justOne: true}
);

- db.myCollection1.remove(ObjectId("598aea8feb8b4de45c012fc8"))
- db.myCollection1.remove({'title':'NoSQL Database'})

//- delete only the first record
- db.myCollection1.remove({'title':'New MongoDB Tutorial 2'}, 1) 

//Remove All Documents from a Collection
- db.myCollection1.remove({}); 

//remove all
- db.myCollection1.remove({}); 
```


## drop		
- delete the 'myCollection1' collection
```js
db.myCollection1.drop1()
//NOTE:	rename 'drop1' to 'drop' if you really want to delete collection (drop1 existing eliminate accidental deletion)
db.test.save( { a: 1} )
db.test.find()

- db.dropDatabase()
```
